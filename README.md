# Note
Please use Node version 20 ( I have used 20.12.0 during development)

Due to heavy data in Orders.csv, I have fetched data as soon as server runs, and stored it in memory, so that for evey API call it should not take too much time. Please let me know if there is issue while running it, i'll deploy it on cloud.

Please run same commands to run the project & test


# Coding Challenge
##########
This coding challenge is designed to assess how you approach and solve a problem that is very similar to the day to day way of working at MerchantSpring. It is based off a real requirement to give you a sense of what the work is like, however it is not real work for our product. It shouldn't take more than a few hours, there are no hidden tricks, please approch this problem as you would if you were releasing it to production.

## Assets

- coding-challenge-ui - this is the front end (React + Typescript)
- coding-challnge-api - this is the backend (NodeJS, Typescript + Express)

### To run both:

`npm run dev`

### To run tests:

`npm run test`

## Requirements

- Provided is a wireframe for a widget we would like you to build (wireframe.jpeg) The application helps marketplace sellers with cross-marketplace data insights. The widget we want you to build is a view of the orders that have been placed that are overdue for shipping.
- The data to populate the widget is provided in two .csv files (coding-challenge-api/data). The orders data is gzipped due to its size.
- Create an REST api that reads in data from the csv and returns it to the front-end
  in the appropriate format
- Create the required components on the front-end to match the wireframe
- Write production quality code and follow best practises for testing
- Note that the wireframe has an option for sorting, please make sure the implementation reflects this
- You can use any third party libraries you want to
- You can refactor the code, both your own and the existing code, as long as it can be run locally with the same commands
- Please don't change the format of the csv
- The code should run locally on your machine (doesn't need to be deployed anywhere)
- Please check the completed challenge in to a git repository and email us the link
- If you have any questions about the challenge or the requirements please feel free to reach out to the team and we will answer them :)
